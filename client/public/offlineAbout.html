With our platform you can upload different types of files needing a translation and we will match them with volunteer translators in real time.</p>
    
    <h1>How are we different?</h1>
    <p className='about' >There are many tools available online providing translation
services. While human-based applications provide
quick and convenient translations, they often lack accuracy,
real-human connection, and cultural knowledge. Human-based translation services, on the other hand, while
accurate and reliable are often costly. Moreover, most of
such services are primarily used for translations of official
documents and not in situations of a daily life. They are
expensive, slow, and not available around the clock. TranslateForGood is free human-based service, available 24/7, and aimed to help in any situation. </p>
