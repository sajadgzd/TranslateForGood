## Overview 
TranslateForGood, is a full-stack web application developed as part of the Computer Science Senior Design Project class. 

It aims to provide free human-based translation services to immigrants, refugees, and tourists, by matching them with volunteering translators from all over the world. It allows its users to register as regular users only or as users and translators. They can submit translation requests, accept translation requests, and communicate via chat through which they can send text messages, voice messages, images, and files. 

The application is powered by the matching algorithm that ensures the best matches between users and volunteering translators based on a variety of attributes. The application interface provides users with many useful tools helping them to keep track of all the requests they were matched with if they are translators, all the requests they submitted, and all the translations that are already in progress. 

TranslateForGood hopes to provide the best experience to users in need of translation who might not be able to afford costly and often slow translation services.
